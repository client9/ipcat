ipcat: datasets for categorizing IP addresses.

The first release "datacenters.csv" is focusing
on IPv4 address that correspond to datacenters, co-location centers,
shared and virtual webhosting providers.  In other words, ip addresses
that end web consumers should not be using.

Statistics

<table>
<tr><th>IPs</th><td>50002250</td></tr>
<tr><th>Records</th><td>2799</td></tr>
<tr><th>ISPs</th><td>511</td></tr>
</table>

What is the file format?
-------------------------

Standard CSV with ip-start, ip-end (inclusive, in dot-notation), name of provider, url
of provider.  IP ranges are non-overlapping, and in sorted order.

Why is hosting provider XXX is missing?
---------------------------------------

It might not be.  Many providers are resellers of another and will be
included under another name or ip range.

Also, as of 16-Oct-2011, many locations from Africa, Latin
America, Korea and Japan are missing.

Or, it might just be missing.  Please let us know!

Why GitHub + CSV?
-------------------------

The goal of the file format and the use of github was designed to make
it really easy for other to send patches or additions.  It also provides
and easy way of keeping track of changes.

How is this generated?
-------------------------

Manually from users like you, and automatically via proprietary
discovery algorithms.
